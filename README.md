# AGL Stats

A stat-gathering app for the Arena Gauntlet League.  

One part "learn golang" one part "do a cool thing for the league", this project is guarenteed to contain questionable code quality and plenty of mistakes.  Proceed with caution!

## Instructions

1. Download Visual Studio Code
2. Grab the code here.
3. (Probably a bunch of golang stuff here that I learned on the fly)
4. Create a secrets file to allow you to use the Google sheets API (TODO: I need to write instructions for this)
5. Create two folders in the root of this project: out & out-perf
6. Run main.go

## How to contribute

If you're interested in helping out, that's cool - I appreciate it.  Please make pull requests, and let me know what you're up to on the AGL Discord server.  Thanks!
